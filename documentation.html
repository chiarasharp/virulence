    <h3>Building a theory</h3><br>
    <p>Why did COVID-19 spread so rapidly in Italy, making us reach one of the highest death rates in the world? There was the need to look at the conditions that made it possible, gathering information through data and articles from multiple sources. It is often demonstrated that the most relevant events may originate from the most unexpected causes. We will indeed have the chance to look at them carefully. Now we are gonna discuss the many aspects taken into consideration during the research. The following list has been considered for all the 20 italian regions:</p><br>
</div>
<ul>
  <li>Air pollution due to PM10 (data files <a href="https://discomap.eea.europa.eu/App/AirQualityStatistics/index.html" target="_blank" >
    here</a>)</li>
  <li>Winter temperatures</li>
  <li>Mobility (data files <a href="https://www.google.com/covid19/mobility/" target="_blank" >
    here</a>)</li>
  <li>Density and age of population (data files <a href="https://data.humdata.org/dataset/italy-high-resolution-population-density-maps-demographic-estimates" target="_blank" >
    here</a>)</li>
  <li>Density of health facilities</li>
</ul>
<div class="container mt-5 text-center">
  <h3>Looking for data</h3><br>
  <p>Multiple sources and datasets have been considered to obtain an exhaustive view of the issue. Data has been provided by the following sitesFor the people who would be interested in sharing the info gathered in here, details about metadata and the relative datasets have been put at everyone's disposal:</p><br>

<h3>Issues analysis</h3><br>
<p>This research took into consideration several aspects to get a clear view of the pandemic's spread mechanisms: it was in fact crucial to list all the steps, for instance the analysis of economy, ethics, laws and many other traits of a country, Italy in our case. These steps have been decribed carefully in the documents section, to provide info about the considered data.</p>
</div>
<div class="container mt-5 text-center">
  <h3>Data mashup</h3><br>
  <p>The datasets used for this project have been merged together in order to get a clear idea of how the social aspects described in the datasets were related to each other.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="container mt-5 text-center">
    <h3>Scanning</h3><br>
    <p>Once the mashup had been completed, the focus moved to political, economical and public/private health aspects, all sharing a crucial role in the COVID-19 spread</p>
    </div>
    <div class="container mt-5 text-center">
      <h3>Sharing results</h3><br>
      <p>The main purpose of this project is to deliver data and explain complex concepts to users in an understandable way. That's why the website includes visualisations of maps and graphs that can be configured by users themselves, in order to let them look at interesting datasets selectively.</p>
